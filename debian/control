Description: Advanced ZFS swap volume manager with safety features
 A comprehensive tool for creating and managing ZFS-based swap volumes
 with advanced safety features, monitoring capabilities, and automatic
 recovery mechanisms.
 .
 Features:
  * System health monitoring (CPU, memory, IO, network)
  * Resource management (ZFS ARC, IO scheduler, process priorities)
  * Security features (SELinux/AppArmor, process verification)
  * Monitoring and debugging (system calls, performance profiling)
  * Backup and recovery (snapshots, transaction rollback)
  * Power management (CPU governor, thermal monitoring)
 .
 The tool ensures optimal swap configuration with proper ZFS properties
 and maintains system stability during the process through extensive
 safety checks and monitoring.
